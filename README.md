A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. See who wins each round!

 I made a computer animated version of Rock Paper Scissor in which the user clicks Rock Paper Scissor on the bottom and built in a function where it randomly chooses Rock Paper Scissor for the computer. Either player wins on the following circumstances:
 Rock beats Scissors;
 Scissors beats Paper;
 Paper beats Rock.
